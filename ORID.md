**I:**

- After experiencing today’s Refactor competition and reflecting on yesterday's team work, many collaboration issues were revealed during the retro meeting. I feel like everyone wanted to improve teamwork, but the process and results were less than ideal. I believed that a team needs a leader, so I took charge and led the team on many tasks. However, my knowledge and experience were not significantly greater than theirs. Unlike my team lead, I couldn’t always tell what was right or wrong. Many of the things I did turned out to be incorrect. I think I need more proactive feedback from my team members, encouraging them to think and communicate whether my approach is correct. Of course, I can also contribute by helping the leader, but it seems like I was the only one overly eager in the team.
- I actually wrote the stream API correctly, but the error occurred because the return value was not updated. Under the team's pressure, I reverted the change, which was supposed to be an opportunity to showcase myself. It's frustrating!
- During the retro, I heard the thoughts of other team members, which will be beneficial for future collaboration and communication.
- For yesterday's refactor homework, it seems my solution was the simplest. Everyone forgot to remove the `WorkFrequency` Entity, but I did it. I’m proud of myself!

**D:**

- Communicate and discuss more with my team members, and actively ask for their opinions and feedback. Encourage open communication and discussion.
- Summarize the issues encountered in the retro meeting in a timely manner, and gradually improve during future exercises.
